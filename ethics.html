          <h3>Impact on Workers</h3>
          <p>Potential impact on workers when implementing robots in warehousing. Automation improves efficiency but may
            displace human workers, causing job losses and economic insecurity.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="box-container-itemEthics">
          <h3>Automation and Efficiency</h3>
          <p> While robots offer automation and improved efficiency in warehousing, ethical considerations arise as these
            advancements can potentially contribute to human job losses and a widening income gap.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="box-container-itemEthics">
          <h3>Income Equality + Social Unrest</h3>
          <p>The displacement of human workers by robots can exacerbate income inequality, leading to social unrest, which
            raises ethical questions about fairness and societal stability.</p>
        </section>

      <h2>Additional Information</h2>
      <div class="box-container">
        <section class="box-container-itemChoices">
          <h3>Economic Impacts</h3>
          <p>While the implementation of robots in warehousing can improve efficiency and reduce costs, there are also
            economic risks to consider. For example, the upfront costs of purchasing and implementing robotics systems can
            be significant, and ongoing maintenance and repair costs may also be high. Additionally, if robots malfunction
            or break down, this can lead to costly downtime and lost productivity. Finally, there may be ongoing training
            costs associated with ensuring that workers are able to operate and maintain the robots effectively.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="box-container-itemChoices">
          <h3>Environmental Impacts</h3>
          <p>Implementing robots in warehousing can have both positive and negative environmental impacts. On the one hand,
            robots can reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by optimising transportation routes and
            reducing the need for human-operated vehicles. However, the production and disposal of robots can also have
            significant environmental impacts, as these processes often require the use of non-renewable resources and can
            generate significant waste. Additionally, the energy consumption associated with operating robots can be
            significant, and the use of robots may increase overall energy demand.</p>
